Welcome to the wondrous world of SilverBullet. A world that once you discover and appreciate, you‚Äôll never want to leave.

_One of us!_

You can go ahead and delete this placeholder content in a second, but before you do, let me quickly show you around.

We‚Äôll do this through a list of **silver bullets**. _Ah, so that explains the name!_ Well, [partially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet).

* Click on the page picker (book icon) icon at the top right, or hit \`Cmd-k\` (Mac) or \`Ctrl-k\` (Linux and Windows) to open the **page picker**.
  * Type the name of a non-existent page to create it.
  * Folders are implicitly created by putting slashes (\`/\`) in the name (even on Windows), e.g. \`My Folder/My Page\`. Don‚Äôt worry about folders existing, SilverBullet will automatically create them if they don‚Äôt.
* Click on the terminal icon (top right), or hit \`Cmd-/\` (Mac) or \`Ctrl-/\` (Linux and Windows), or tap the screen with 3 fingers at the same time (on mobile) to open the **command palette**. From here you can run various useful and perhaps less useful commands.
* Select some text and hit \`Cmd-b\` (Mac) or \`Ctrl-b\` (Windows/Linux) to make it **bold**, or \`Cmd-i\` (Mac) or \`Ctrl-i\` (Windows/Linux) to make it _italic_.
* You can create links to pages using the \`[[other page]]\` syntax, for instance: [[aspiring page]]. When you link to a non-existent page it will initially show up in orange (to indicate it does not yet exist), but once you click it ‚Äî¬†you will create the page automatically (only for real when you actually enter some text).
* Start typing \`:party\` to trigger the emoji picker üéâ
* Type \`/\` somewhere in the text to invoke a **slash command**.
* If this matches your personality type, there is also an \`Editor: Toggle Vim Mode\` command to switch to Vim mode. If you cannot figure out how to exit it (classic vim issue), just run that same command again. _Phew!_
* As you may have noticed, while SilverBullet uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) underneath, it also ‚Äúlive previews‚Äù it to give a bit more of a WYSIWYG feel. You can always move your cursor ‚Äúinto‚Äù the underlying code by \`Alt-clicking\` it (even links and widgets, which we‚Äôll get to later).

While SilverBullet implements (most) of [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), it also adds a few extensions that are SilverBullet-specific. Most notably, it adds the \`\${Lua expression}\` syntax to render Lua expressions inline.

Using SilverBullet‚Äôs Lua APIs, you can do all kinds of cool stuff. For instance, query your space for the last 3 modified pages. _Exciting!_

\${query[[from index.tag "page" order by lastModified desc limit 3]]}

There‚Äôs a whole world out there to explore, but let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. First, have some fun and add some content to your fresh space.

Then we‚Äôll talk.
