Metadata is data about data. Most [[Objects]] have a set of default attributes that can be augmented in a few additional ways:

* [[Tags]]: to tag the object (and add to the `tags` attribute directly)
* [[Frontmatter]]: at the top of [[Pages]], a [[YAML]] encoded block can be used to define additional attributes to a page
* [[Attributes]] syntax
