SilverBullet uses a “live preview” markdown editor. This mechanism is heavily inspired by [Obsidian’s live preview mode](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update).

It reduces visual noise by not constantly showing [[Markdown]] codes such as `[SilverBullet website](https://silverbullet.md)`, only showing the underlying Markdown formatting code when the cursor is placed inside.

In SilverBullet, you can always see the underlying format by moving your cursor “inside.” **Alt-clicking** on any piece of formatted text will move your cursor there and reveal the underlying (markdown) code.
