Slash commands are built-in to SilverBullet. You can trigger them by typing a `/` in your text (after whitespace).

The [[🔌 Core]] plug provides a few helpful ones:

* `/h1` through `/h4` to turn the current line into a header
* `/hr` to insert a horizontal rule (`---`)
* `/table` to insert a markdown table (whoever can remember this syntax without it)
* `/snippet` see [[🔌 Core/Templates@snippets]]
* `/today` to insert today’s date
* `/tomorrow` to insert tomorrow’s date
