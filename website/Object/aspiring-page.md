[[Aspiring Pages]] (codified using the `aspiring-page` tag) are pages that are linked to, but not yet created. [[Like this one]].

Internally SilverBullet uses these in [[^Library/Std/Pages/Maintenance]], page complete and the page picker (to hint at pages to still be created).

Example query (lists all aspiring pages in this space, which should just be the one created at the top of this page):

${query[[from index.tag "aspiring-page"]]}
