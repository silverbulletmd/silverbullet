The primary thing you’ll be doing in SilverBullet (hopefully) is creating and editing pages. Pages are written in [[Markdown]], can contain [[Metadata]] and are kept on the server as text files.

Page _names_ are relatively free-form, but have to adhere to a few [[Names#Rules]].

# Types of pages
Your [[Spaces|space]] will contain two types of pages:

* **Content pages:** this is the core of your space — your notes. You navigate between these using the [[Page Picker]].
* [[Meta Pages]] these are pages that contain implementation details _about_ your space (they are “meta”). A lot of these will be part of [[Libraries]]. You navigate between these using the [[Meta Picker]].
