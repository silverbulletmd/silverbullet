SilverBullet has been designed to be programmable from the ground up. The core of SilverBullet is relatively small, see [[Architecture]].

On top of this core, a lot of functionality is built as [[Plugs]] and [[Space Lua]] scripts.

While not as fundamental in this approach as editors like [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), it draws a lot of inspiration from it.
