From the original [Local First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/) article:

> Local first is a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration *and* ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data.
