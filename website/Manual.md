Welcome to the wonderful world of SilverBullet. The goal of this manual is to give you a broad sense of how to use this
tool and what it‚Äôs capable of. However, its full capabilities are yet to be discovered. You too may find new and
creative ways to use the various SilverBullet features in ways nobody previously thought of.

However, that is all unlikely to happen unless you understand what SilverBullet can actually do. So let‚Äôs give you a bit
of a sense.

The biggest hurdle to get over with SilverBullet is that you need to get this thing running. And as of yet, the only way
to do that is to install and deploy it yourself. ü§∑
