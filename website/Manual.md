Welcome to the wonderful world of SilverBullet. The goal of this manual is to give you a broad sense of how to use this tool and what it‚Äôs capable of. However, its full capabilities are yet to be discovered. You too may find new and creative ways to use the various SilverBullet features in ways nobody previously thought of.

However, that is all unlikely to happen unless you understand what SilverBullet can actually do. So let‚Äôs give you a bit of a sense.

# Keeping up-to-date
* [[CHANGELOG]]: what‚Äôs new in SilverBullet? This page will give you the latest details. It‚Äôs worth monitoring this page.

# Installation and deployment
The biggest hurdle to get over with SilverBullet is that you need to get this thing running. And as of yet, the only way to do that is to install and deploy it yourself. ü§∑

* [[Install]]: Installation instructions for various setups
* [[Authelia]]: configuring SilverBullet with [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) authentication.
