This library is highly recommended for everybody to import. It provides a lot of basic functionality in SilverBullet that youâ€™ll appreciate.

Some examples:
* [[Table of Contents]]
* [[Linked Mentions]]
* [[Linked Tasks]]
* All the slash commands you know and love, ranging from `/h1` to `/task` to `/table` to `/code` to `/query` to `/template` to `/today` to...
* Some useful general purpose pages such as [[Library/Core/Page/Maintenance]], [[Library/Core/Quick Notes]] and [[Library/Core/Page/Template Index]].

# Installation
In your [[SETTINGS]] list the following under `libraries:`
```yaml
libraries:
- import: "[[!v1.silverbullet.md/Library/Core/*]]"
```
Then run the {[Libraries: Update]} command to install it.

See [[Libraries#Configuring libraries]] for more details.
