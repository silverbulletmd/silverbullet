SilverBullet is private because you [[Self Hosted|self host]] it, enabled [[Authentication]] and are not giving anybody else the username and password (_right!?_).

_You_ are in control of the server it runs on, and communication between your browser and your server is secured via [[TLS]]. It is a way to be [[Data Sovereignty|data sovereign]].

SilverBullet does not support end-to-end encryption yet (although you can enable [[Client Encryption]]). Therefore, you are in charge of securing your server using standard security practices (e.g. by enabling disk encryption to encrypt your disk).
