While SilverBullet is free to use, it is not free to develop. A lot of time is poured into evolving and maintaining the product: building new features, reviewing contributions, and fixing bugs.

If you are a SilverBullet user, consider sponsoring the project financially. You likely already pay for other (non-open source) software, why not SilverBullet as well?

# Why?
While the project is largely a labor of love, and a lot of volunteers contribute significantly, it does benefit from funding. The more funding, the more time can be spent to make this product as good as it can be and to recoup some of its costs.

# How?
There are a few ways to financially support the project at the moment, ordered by preference:

1. [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/zef) (preferred)
2. [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/silverbulletmd)
3. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cw/silverbulletmd)
4. [PayPal](https://paypal.me/zefhemel)

If you are interested in becoming a corporate sponsor, reach out to [Zef Hemel directly](mailto:zef@zef.me) to discuss options.

# What?
There are two costs of the project right now:
1. Infrastructure cost to run SilverBullet websites ([silverbullet.md](https://silverbullet.md) and [community.silverbullet.md](https://community.silverbullet.md), primarily)
2. [[Zef]]’s time for development and maintenance of the product

Infrastructure costs are relatively low, but [[Zef]]’s time is not. He has a family to support, and needs to reasonably share his time between SilverBullet and other activities that function as a source of income. The more funding coming in for SilverBullet, the more of his time can be dedicated to SilverBullet, the better the product becomes. It’s as simple as that.
