A _space_ is SilverBullet terminology for a workspace, or project. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) calls this a vault, [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) calls it a graph. You may think of it as a [[Folders|folder]] or a directory — because in practical terms, that’s all it is.

Feel free to back-up or manipulate your space’s folder and its files with whatever tool you like — you don’t have to use SilverBullet exclusively. You may want to turn your space’s folder into a git repository, for instance, and do version control and back-ups that way — in which case you may appreciated the [[Plugs/Git]] plug.

A space consists of
* [[Folders]]
* [[Pages]]
* [[Attachments]]

# Folder lay-out
Every space in SilverBullet at the very least has an index page (by default named `index.md`) and a [[SETTINGS]] page (named `SETTINGS.md`). If you install custom [[Plugs]], these will be kept under `_plug` in your space’s folder.

Likely you will be using [[Libraries]] that implement core functionality. In this case there will be a `Library` folder in your space as well.
