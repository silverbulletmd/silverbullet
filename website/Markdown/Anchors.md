Anchor represent named locations within a page and are defined using the $anchor syntax. They can then be referenced within the page using [[$anchor]], or cross-page via [[Markdown/Anchors$anchor]].

The legacy syntax is to use `@` instead of `$` for referencing, which is still supported but deprecated.
