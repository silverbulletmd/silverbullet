A _space_ is SilverBullet terminology for a workspace, or project, or instance. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) calls this a vault, [LogSeq](https://logseq.com/) calls it a graph. You may think of it as a [[Folder]] or a directory — because in practical terms, that’s all it is.

Feel free to back up or manipulate your space’s folder and its files with whatever tool you like — you don’t have to use SilverBullet exclusively. You may want to turn your space’s folder into a git repository, for instance, and do version control and back-ups that way.

A space consists of
* [[Folder]]
* [[Page]] and [[Meta Page]]
* [[Document]]

# Folder layout
Every space in SilverBullet at the very least has an index page (by default named `index.md`) and a [[CONFIG]] page (named `CONFIG.md`). If you use [[Library]], you will likely have a `Library/` folder as well.
