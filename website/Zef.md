Hi! My name is [Zef Hemel](https://github.com/zefhemel/), and I have been working on SilverBullet since February 2022. For most of this time it’s been purely a labor of love and was (implicitly) funded by the companies I worked for. Today, I more deliberately try to spend time on making SilverBullet everything it can be, and for this I rely on [[Funding]].
