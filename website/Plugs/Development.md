> **warning** Unstable APIs
> The plug APIs are still unstable and tend to change. You’re welcome to experiment and build stuff, but do take into account that things tend to change. Also note that all this is horrifically under documented.

The easiest way to get started is to click the “Use this template” on the [silverbullet-plug-template](https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet-plug-template) repo.

Generally, every plug consists of a YAML manifest file named `yourplugname.plug.yaml`. This file defines all functions that form your plug. To be loadable by SilverBullet (or any PlugOS-based system for that matter), it needs to be compiled into a bundle (ending with `.plug.js`).

Generally, the way to do this is to run `silverbullet plug:compile` as follows:

```shell
silverbullet plug:compile yourplugname.plug.yaml
```

During development, you may want to compile plugs in debug mode, which will not minify them and generate source maps:

```shell
silverbullet plug:compile --debug yourplugname.plug.yaml
```

If you use the plug template, this command is wrapped in your `deno.jsonc` file, so you can just run either:

```shell
deno task build
```

to build it once, or

```shell
deno task watch
```

to build it and rebuild it when files are changed. This will write a `yourplugname.plug.js` file into the same folder. 

For development it’s easiest to simply copy the `.plug.js` file into your space’s `_plug/` folder:

```shell
cp myplug.plug.js ~/myspace/_plug/
```

Within seconds (watch your browser’s JavaScript console), your plug should be picked up both on the server and, synced to your browser and loaded. No need to even reload the page.

## Debugging
Since plugs run in your browser, you can use the usual browser debugging tools. When you `console.log` things, these logs will appear in your browser’s JavaScript console.

## Distribution
Once you’re happy with your plug, you can distribute it in various ways:

- You can put it on github by simply committing the resulting `.plug.js` file there and instructing users to point to by adding
  `- github:yourgithubuser/yourrepo/yourplugname.plug.js` to their `PLUGS` file
- Add a release in your github repo and instruct users to add the release as `- ghr:yourgithubuser/yourrepo` or if they need a specific release `- ghr:yourgithubuser/yourrepo/release-name`
  - You need to upload the plug file as asset in the release, with a name matching your repository, e.g, `yourrepo.plug.js`
  - If your repository name starts with "silverbullet-", like `silverbullet-foo`, both `silverbullet-foo.plug.js` and `foo.plug.js` asset names will be tried
- You can put it on any other web server, and tell people to load it via https, e.g., `- https://mydomain.com/mypugname.plug.js`.
