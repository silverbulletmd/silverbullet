Data Sovereignty (in our definition) is the principle that your data ought to be controlled by _you_. _You_ ought to have control over your own data, how it is accessed, processed and used.

SilverBullet supports data sovereignty by taking the approach of [[Self Hosted]], combined with [[Open Source]], [[Zero Tracking]], and leveraging the [[Browser]] (rather than apps) for universal access.
