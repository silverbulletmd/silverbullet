SilverBullet does not include any trackers or telemetry in its software. No tracking or private data is sent to SilverBullet (or any other) servers at any time.

The (mild) exception to this are the silverbullet.md and community.silverbullet.md websites where we do use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) to get _some_ sense of what people are interested in.
